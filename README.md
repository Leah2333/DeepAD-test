# DeepAD-Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Simulation
This repository contains the implementation of a deep-learning model for anomaly detection.

---
## Modules
- Macroscopic route recommendation
- Microscopic lane changing
---
## `DeepAD-test` Directory:
- `micro_load.py`: Loading datasets and their respective labels.
  - `load_data`: Loads the dataset.
  - `load_label`: Loads the labels for the dataset.
- `micro_multi_load.py`: An extension of `micro_load.py` tailored for handling multi-modal data.
  - `multi_load_data`: Loads multi-modal data.
  - `multi_load_label`: Loads labels for the multi-modal data.
- `micro_train.py`: Contains the training and testing protocol for the model.
  - `train`: Handles the training process of a model.
  - `test`: Tests the trained model.
  - `main`: The main function that orchestrates the training and testing processes.

These scripts form the foundation of a deep learning project, with functionalities for data loading and model training.
