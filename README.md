# DeepAD-Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Simulation

## Modules
- Macroscopic route recommendation
- Microscopic lane changing

This repository contains the implementation of a deep-learning model for anomaly detection.

## Python Scripts:
- `micro_load.py`: Responsible for loading datasets and their respective labels.
- `micro_multi_load.py`: An extension of `micro_load.py` tailored for handling multi-modal data.
- `micro_train.py`: Contains the training and testing logic for the model.

## Directories:
- `data`: Contains the datasets required for the model.
- `model`: Houses the model architectures and related utilities.
- `output`: Contains the output results from the model.
- `utils`: Utility scripts and functions to assist in various tasks.

To set up and run the project, refer to the main `README.md` in the root directory.
